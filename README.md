# PRODIGY_DS_03
Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

**Project Overview**
This project builds a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on their medical attributes.
We used the Heart Disease dataset and performed training, evaluation, and feature importance analysis.

**Dataset**
Source: Heart Disease Dataset

**Attributes:** age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, maximum heart rate, ST depression, number of major vessels, etc.
Target: target (1 = disease, 0 = no disease)

**Technologies Used:**
Python,
Pandas,
Scikit-learn,
Seaborn,
Matplotlib

**Results:**
Accuracy achieved: ~80â€“85% on the test data.

**Visualizations:**
Feature Correlation Heatmap to understand relationships between features.
Decision Tree Visualization (Top 3 Levels for clarity).
Feature Importance Plot to see which attributes matter most
